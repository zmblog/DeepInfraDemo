Small project teaching my how to use deep infra (past the introductory docs, which are quite cool in themselves - I'll link it below!) done in Google Colab. 
The project basically involves reading a text document from google docs (give it your documentID) and then leveraging DeepInfra to gain access to meta Llama3-70B LLM so we can ask the model some questions about the doc.
Oh make sure to upload a credential.json as shown here: ![image](https://github.com/zmblog/DeepInfraDemo/assets/60574742/f7459d74-28f4-45a8-b2a0-11a2cfcce47b)
This can be retreived by following this: https://developers.google.com/drive/api/quickstart/python#install_the_google_client_library
Just select web application instead of desktop for the purposes here.
