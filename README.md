Small project teaching my how to use deep infra (past the introductory docs, which are quite cool in themseleves). I'll link it below!
The project basically involves reading a text document from google docs (give it your documentID) and then leverages deepinfra to gain access to meta Llama3-70B LLM so we can ask the model some questions about the doc.
